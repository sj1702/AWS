• If you want to run any program We need an operating system OS, only and
only for running(executing) programs. Programs can be Notepad, Video
Player, Web server, or your favorite game. There is no way to interact with
the operating system without the program.
• If you have a program then it will generally require an operating system to
run.
• In the real world we need hardware to maintain the OS or run any program
• Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution
model that enables developers to build and run application code without
provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.
• With the help of serverless we can manage all infrastructure they provide
scalability
• So instead of investing in physical hardware or data centers, organizations
can choose to lease or outsource their computing resources from some
service providers, and that provider is known as cloud service providers.
Eg. AWS cloud, Azure, etc
• Outsource means if you want hardware to run the program we take
Hardware from outside the world
• Cloud computing allows businesses to access virtualized computing
resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, over the
internet.
• Cloud computing gives operating systems and stores data from outside
means we don’t need real hardware
• For example, Netflix is a media company, and its core business is streaming
movies and TV shows. It doesn't make sense for Netflix to own and manage
its data centers and computing resources. That would be a distraction from
its core business, and it would also be expensive. By outsourcing its
computing resources to a third-party provider, Netflix can focus on what it
does best such as content creation and customer experience, without having
to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.
• Many companies offer cloud computing services. Some of the most popular
cloud service providers include:
➢ Amazon Web Services (AWS): AWS is a cloud computing platform
provided by Amazon.
➢ Microsoft Azure: Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform.
➢ Google Cloud Platform (GCP): GCP is Google's cloud computing.
And many more.
• The "pay as you go" model in cloud computing refers to a pricing model
where users pay for the cloud services they consume based on actual usage.
Instead of making upfront investments in hardware and infrastructure, users
are charged based on the resources they utilize, such as computing power,
storage, network bandwidth, and other services.

• In cloud computing, RAM and CPU are known as computing devices or
units, while hard disks are known as storage devices or units.
• The term "cloud" in cloud computing is a metaphor for the Internet. It
represents the fact that cloud computing services are delivered over the
Internet, rather than being installed on a local computer. As a user, you don't
need to know where the resources are physically located. You only need to
know that they are available to you when you need them.
• One of the biggest reasons Why AWS is the top leader in the CC field is the
“Global network of AWS Regions. AWS has the most extensive global
cloud infrastructure. No other cloud provider offers as many Regions with
multiple Availability Zones connected by low latency”.
• Low latency means if you search for something on your website and your
website gives the result after a long time then the customer does not come to
your website AWS provides a Lot of Availability Zones
• when you go and search After that AWS goes and searches the result in the
nearest Availability Zones then we solve the Low latency
• In Availability Zones they have a lot of hardware or compute units
• Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform offered by
Amazon. AWS provides a wide range of cloud services, offering over 200
different services and features across various categories.
• If you want to launch an operating system (OS) in AWS, the Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service is commonly used.
• An availability zone (AZ) is a physical location within a region. Each AZ
consists of one or more discrete data centers. A region is a geographic area
that contains multiple AZs.
[Free AWS Enablement Training]
• AWS regions and availability zones are designed to provide high
availability and redundancy for your applications and data. By launching
your applications and data in multiple AZs, you can protect them from the
failure of a single AZ.
• For example we launch the instance in the Mumbai region and you store the
data but for some reason, your data gets deleted for that AWS launch same
data center near the old data center
• If your website gets down then they go to the other AZ and give the result to
the client
• Also AWS stores all data in different regions means your data is stored in
different data centers
• In the Mumbai region we have three AZ
[Free AWS Enablement Training]
• Aws launched a total of 33 regions in the different counties and in every
region we have different AZ
• There are three main ways to launch an operating system (OS):
➢ Bare metal is the most traditional way to launch an OS. In this
approach, the OS is installed directly on the physical hardware. But it
also requires more hardware resources and can be more difficult to
manage.
➢ Virtualization allows you to run multiple OS on the same physical
hardware. This is done by creating virtual machines (VMs), which are
software-based representations of physical computers. VMs can be
used to run different operating systems or to isolate different
applications from each other.
➢ Containerization is a newer technology that allows you to run
applications in isolated containers. Containers are similar to VMs, but
they are more lightweight and portable.
➢ Cloud Platform
[Free AWS Enablement Training]
• AWS uses a variety of methods for launching OS, including bare metal,
virtualization, and containerization. The specific method that is used depends
on the specific service that you are using.
• For example, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) allows you to launch
virtual machines (VMs) that can run a variety of operating systems.
• Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) allows you to launch containers,
which are lightweight processes that share the same operating system kernel.
• In AWS, the boot or OS image is referred to as an Amazon Machine Image
(AMI). An AMI is a pre-configured template that contains the necessary
information to launch an EC2 instance with a specific operating system and
additional software or configurations.
To launch an EC2 instance in AWS:
• Go to the AWS Management Console and sign in to your account
• Click the "EC2" service after searching for it.
[Free AWS Enablement Training]
• If you want to launch an instance in the Mumbai region but are currently in
another region, you should first go to the Mumbai region to do so.
• On the EC2 Dashboard, click on the "Launch Instances" button. This will
initiate the process of launching a new EC2 instance.
• Enter the name of the instance.
[Free AWS Enablement Training]
• Choose the appropriate AMI based on your desired OS and requirements.
• Select the instance type that best suits your needs in terms of CPU, memory,
and storage.
• You need a key to access the instance. However, you can disable it right now
and use another method to log in without the key that you will see in the
upcoming process.
• In the Network Settings section, we will keep everything to default. We can
see SSH traffic is allowed from Anywhere (any IP Address).
[Free AWS Enablement Training]
• Click on the "Launch Instances" button. AWS will start provisioning the
EC2 instance based on your selected configuration.
• Connect to an AWS EC2 instance without a key: Select the instance that you
want to connect to and click on the "Connect" button located at the top of the
console.
• Click on "Connect".
[Free AWS Enablement Training]
• You will now be connected to the instance in a web browser. You can use
the console to manage the instance.
• From the list of instances displayed on the EC2 Dashboard, select the
instance you want to terminate or stop.
• With the instance selected, you have two options:
1. To permanently remove the instance, click on the "Instance State" button, and
then choose "Terminate". Confirm the termination when prompted.
2. To temporarily stop the instance and preserve its data and configuration, click
on the "Instance State" button, and then choose "Stop". Confirm the stop action
when prompted.
