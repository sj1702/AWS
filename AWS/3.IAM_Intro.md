Data breaches are due to either weak, stolen, or default passwords used. There is a saying in the cybersecurity world that goes like this “No matter how good your chain is it’s only as strong as your weakest link.” and exactly hackers use the weakest links in the organization to infiltrate. They usually use phishing attacks to infiltrate an organization and if they get at least one person to fall for it, it’s a serious turn of events from thereon. They use the stolen credentials to plant back doors, install malware or exfiltrate confidential data, all of which will cause serious losses for an organization. And so Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a combination of policies and technologies that allows organizations to identify users and provide the right form of access as and when required.

## What is IAM?
 - Stands for Identity and Access Management.

 - IAM is a web service in AWS that helps manage user access to AWS resources.

 - IAM allows you to create and manage AWS users and groups, and control their permissions to access AWS services.

 - IAM provides a way to securely manage access to AWS resources, without having to share AWS account credentials.

 - IAM is used to control who is authenticated and authorized to use AWS resources.

 - The first identity in IAM is the root user, which has access to all AWS resources.

 - The primary resources in IAM are users, groups, roles, policies, and identity providers.

 - IAM roles are like IAM users, but they are intended to be assumed by anyone who needs them, and they do not have any credentials associated with them.

 - IAM can be used from the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDK.


 ## IAM roles have several advantages over using access keys:

 - **Temporary credentials:**IAM roles provide temporary security credentials that can be assumed by entities. These credentials have an expiration time, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

 - **Least privilege access:** You can assign fine-grained permissions to IAM roles, granting only the necessary access required for a specific task or service. This principle of least privilege enhances security by minimizing potential damage if credentials are compromised.

 - **Flexibility:** IAM roles can be easily associated with multiple entities, allowing for centralized access management and reducing administrative overhead.

 - **Trust relationships:** IAM roles can establish trust relationships with other AWS accounts or services, enabling cross-account or cross-service access. This is useful when you need to grant permissions to external entities or to enable services to access resources on your behalf.
